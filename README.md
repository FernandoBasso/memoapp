# MemoApp

This is MemoApp, an application that attempts to be similar to Zim Wiki, except using Markdown as the underlying language.

Future ideas may involve supporting extra stuff not present in Markdown, perhaps something like Asciidoctor, and even far in the future, include fetures found in Anki for flashcard-related stuff.

Application has these main areas and features:

- Top Menu Bar
- Top Tool Bar
- Tree View (left)
- Main Editing Window (center)
- Headings and Index of main elements of current editing view (right)
- Very searchable and navigable
- Markdown behind the scenes
